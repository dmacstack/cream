Runs pre-commit and pre-push Git hooks to 
[avoid breaking the local master branch](http://glebbahmutov.com/blog/never-break-master-by-accident/)
or the [remote master](http://glebbahmutov.com/blog/never-break-remote-master-again/).

### Installation

It's advised to install this module as `devDependency` in your `package.json`
file so it doesn't get installed on production servers. Run:

```
npm install pre-git --save-dev
```

### Configuration

Specify commands to run on *commit* and on *push* in your package.json

```json
"scripts": {
  "test": "node-qunit *.js"
},
"pre-commit": [
  "grunt jshint",
  "npm version"
],
"post-commit": "git status",
"pre-push": [
  "rm -rf node_modules",
  "npm install",
  "grunt build",
  "grunt test"
],
"post-merge": "npm install"
```

Related project: [post-merge-make](https://github.com/bahmutov/post-merge-make)
runs `make post-merge` after pull or merge.

## Details

You can always skip pre-commit hook (but not pre-push hook!) by using `-n` option

    git commit -m "done, don't check me" -n

You can skip the pre-push hook using `--no-verify` option

To run just the hook (for example to test what it does), execute

```bash
.git/hooks/pre-commit
.git/hooks/pre-push
```

Since there might be no changes to push, you can force the `pre-commit` hook to execute
using `-f` or `--force` argument

```bash
.git/hooks/pre-commit -f
```
